# Solving the maximum co-2-plex problem with ILP


## What is a co-k-plex

Given a graph G=(V,E) and a positive integer k, a co-k-plex is a set of vertices inducing a subgraph of degree at most k-1.
k-plexes, that are co-k-plexes of the complement graphs are sets of highly connected vertices. For this reason, such kind
of object is used to modelize communities in social networks and other fields such a philogeny and others.

## Aim of this project

This projects aims at solving the maximum weighted 2-plex problem. We do this by solving the complement problem using integer
linear programming. The code is made in Julia using JuMP and CPLEX.


## Content

This files contain some simple graph heuristics and algorithm to decompose a graph into smaller graphs on which it will be easier
to compute the maximum weighted co-2-plex. 


We mainly propose three new ILP formulatiosn that are declined into two variants each. This implies 6 new algorithms.
These new formulations are formally described in the companion paper.
